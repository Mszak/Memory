# Memory
Memory game
This is a simple memory game, containing 64 fields = 32 pairs. Icons for those fields are taken from www.iconfinder.com as
they were free. 
The goal of game is to simply click pairs of specific images in order to remove them from board. When all pairs are found
player wins the game. To make things a bit more challenging, each time a player will not find a single pair in moves equal half
of the remaining fields(f.e. if there is 56 fields on board, after 28th move, and as a move we consider pressing a field) - the 
board will shuffle.
